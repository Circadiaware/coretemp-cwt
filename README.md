# coretemp-cwt
Circadian rhythm nadirs inference using continuous wave transforms on non invasive core body temperature. Allows visualization and also outputs actual minimum temperature times for each day. Code is messy (was hacked together for personal use and then published w/o modification)

## Note about private information in code

I don't mind that there's CORE authorization headers in the code. I really doubt anyone will use it to mess with my core temp data :)
